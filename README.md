# Crypto Aggregator App

This is a project for a website to let users visualize key data from crypto markets in an easy way

Simply pick the token's name or symbol from the search bar, and it will display in a column. Use as many columns as you like, or as much as your screen can show.

This site uses the API from coinmarketcap.com. None of the info the website displays should be considered investment advice.

## Local Setup

Create an account on CoinMarketCap's developer portal, to obtain the free API key. The website gives you more than enough credits for personal use.

Once done, add your unique API key to your .env file.
